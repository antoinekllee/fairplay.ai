Realtime -> webhook

Making webhook consmuer:

-   Shared in group/drive link in a folder w/ 2 pieces of code
-   webhook.site -> testing webhooks
-   Create bot with the /create_bot, do this once per meeting session
-   They will be admitted to join
-   Need same email as the host of the meeting - else permission issues
-

Transcription coming live as objects constantly pushed

API to remove bot at end of meeting

Only 2 options -> get audio and get transcript, no video stream available

Deepgram -> default for audio transcription

Tracks

-   Any ai agent, chatbot agents, voice agents
-   Voice + meeting agents -> voice based communication, automate meetings with REALTIME transcriptions and insights
-   MCP -> make MCP servers, build integrations

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
